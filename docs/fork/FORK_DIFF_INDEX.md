# Fork Diff Index

This file tracks generic fork additions and upstream-facing changes introduced after the upstream base recorded in `docs/fork/UPSTREAM_BASE.md`.

## Current Status

PR-000 and PR-001 are implemented locally. PR-001 adds an instance-level experimental feature flag framework for safely gating later fork roadmap work.
